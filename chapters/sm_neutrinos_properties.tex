\section{The Standard Model}

The \textit{Standard Model (SM)} of particle physics is a Yang-Mills theory \sidecite[0.8cm]{yang_mills} providing very accurate predictions of weak, strong, and \textit{electromagnetic (EM)} interactions. It is a relativistic quantum field theory that relies on gauge invariance, where all matter is made up of fermions, which are divided into quarks and leptons, and bosons describe the interactions between the fermions that have to fulfil the overall symmetry of the theory. Leptons are excitations of Dirac-type fermion fields.

The initial idea of the theory is associated with the works of Weinberg \sidecite{weinberg}, Glashow \sidecite{Glashow}, and Salam \cite{Salam}, that proposed a unified description of EM and weak interactions as a theory of a spontaneously broken SU(2) x U(1) symmetry for leptons, predicting a neutral massive vector boson $Z^0$, a massive charged vector boson $W^\pm$, and a massless photon $\gamma$ as the gauge bosons. The Higgs mechanism \sidecite{higgs}, describing the breaking of the symmetry, predicts the existence of an additional scalar particle, the Higgs boson, giving the $W^\pm$ and $Z^0$ bosons their mass. The Higgs boson was discovered in 2012 at the LHC\todo{Also cite this? Didn't find a good reference, only the press releases.}.

Gell-Mann and Zweig proposed the quark model in 1964 \sidecite{gellmann, zweig}, which was completed by the discovery of non-abelian gauge theories \cite{non_abel_gauge} to form the SU(3) symmetry of the strong interaction called \textit{quantum chromodynamics (QCD)}. QDC describes the interaction between quarks and gluons which completed the full picture of the SM in the mid-1970s. Together with the electroweak theory, the SM is a SU(3)$_C$ x SU(2)$_L$ x U(1)$_Y$ local gauge symmetry, with the conserved quantities $C$, \textit{color}, $L$, \textit{left-handed chirality}, and $Y$, \textit{weak hypercharge}

In the following, the basic properties of the SM are described, following the derivations of \sidecite{giunti, schwartz}.

\labtab{fermions}
\end{margintable}

The number of bosons is dependent on the generators of the symmetry groups, while strength depends on coupling constants. There are eight massless gluons as generators of the SU(3)$_C$ group, corresponding to the strong force which conserves color charge. The spontaneous symmetry breaking of the SU(2)$_L$ x U(1)$_Y$ group mixes the $W_1, W_2, W_3$, and $B$ boson fields into the massive bosons as
\begin{equation}
    W^\pm = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (W_1 \mp i W_2)
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    Z^0 = \cos \theta_W W_3 - \sin \theta_W B
    \;,
\end{equation}
with $\theta_W$ being the \textit{Weinberg angle}. The massless photon field is given by
\begin{equation}
    A = \sin \theta_W W_3 + \cos \theta_W B
\end{equation}
and its conserved quantity is the electric charge $Q$. Fermions are divided into six quarks and six leptons. Weak, strong, and EM force act on the quarks, and they are always found in bound form as baryons or mesons. Leptons do not participate in the strong interaction and only the electrically charged leptons are massive and are effected by the EM force, while neutrinos are massless and only interact via the weak force. Each charged lepton has an associated neutrino, which it interacts with in \textit{charged-current (CC)} weak interactions, that will be explained in more detail in \refsec{weak_interactions}. The fermions are listed in \reftab{fermions}.


\subsection{Electroweak Symmetry Breaking}

To elaborate the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking through which the gauge bosons of the weak interaction acquire their masses, the Lagrangian of the Higgs field is considered as
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_\rm{Higgs} = (D_\mu \Phi^\dagger) (D^\mu \Phi) - \lambda \left( \Phi^\dagger \Phi - \frac{v^2}{2} \right) ^2
    \;,
    \labeq{higgs_lagrangian}
\end{equation}
with parameters $\lambda$ and $v$, where $\lambda$ is assumed to be positive. $\Phi$ is the Higgs doublet, which is defined as
\begin{equation}
    \Phi = \binom{\Phi^+}{\Phi^0}
    \;,
    \labeq{higgs_doublet}
\end{equation}
with the charged component $\Phi^+$ and the neutral component $\Phi^0$. The covariant derivative is given by
\begin{equation}
    D_\mu = \partial_\mu - i g_2 \frac{\sigma^i}{2} W^i_\mu - \frac{1}{2} i g_1 B_\mu
    \;,
    \labeq{covariant_derivative}
\end{equation}
with the Pauli matrices $\sigma^i$ and the gauge boson fields $W^i_\mu$ and $B_\mu$ of the SU(2)$_L$ and U(1)$_Y$ groups, respectively. The coupling constants $g_2$ and $g_1$ are the respective coupling constants which are related to the Weinberg angle as $\tan{\theta_W} = \frac{g_1}{g_2}$. The Higgs potential has a non-zero \textit{vacuum expectation value (vev)} at the minimum of the potential at $\Phi^\dagger \Phi = \frac{v^2}{2}$. Since the vacuum is electrically neutral, it can only come from a neutral component of the Higgs doublet as
\begin{equation}
    \Phi_\rm{vev} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \binom{0}{v}
    \;.
    \labeq{higgs_vev}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Fermion Masses}

The mass term for charged fermions with spin-1/2 is given by
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_\rm{Dirac} = m (\bar{\Psi}_R \Psi_L - \bar{\Psi}_L \Psi_R)
    \;,
    \labeq{dirac_lagrangian}
\end{equation}
composed of the product of left- and right-handed Weyl spinors $\Psi_{L/R}$. This term is not invariant under SU(2)$_L$ x U(1)$_Y$ gauge transformations, but adding a Yukawa term
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_\rm{Yukawa} = -y \bar{L}_L \Phi e_R + {\rm h.c.}
    \;,
    \labeq{yukawa_lagrangian}
\end{equation}
coupling the fermion fields to the Higgs field, recovers the invariance and gives the fermions their masses. Here, $y$ is the Yukawa coupling constant and $\bar{L}_L$ is the SU(2)$_L$ doublet. With the vev, this results in the mass term for the charged leptons and down-type quarks of $-m_e(\bar{e}_L e_R + \bar{e}_R e_L)$ with $m_e = \frac{y v}{\sqrt{2}}$.


\section{Evidence for Beyond Standard Model Physics}

BSM stuff!

it cannot explain some observations/phenomena like gravity (incompatibility with general relativity) or cosmological observations (dark matter, dark energy, matter-antimatter asymmetry)

and it does not predict neutrinos to have mass, which is experimentally proven by neutrino oscillations, so some extensions to the SM is needed in order to explain them

\subsection{A Solution to (some of) the Problems}

\todo{Re-write/re-formulate this section (copied from HNL technote).}

Extensions to the Standard Model (SM) that add \textit{Heavy Neutral Leptons (HNLs)} provide a good explanation for the origin of neutrino masses through different seesaw mechanisms \sidecite{PTP.64.1103}.
\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics{figures/hnl_simulation/theory/UtauN_custom_plots_LF_grid_white.png}
  \caption[Current $|U_{\tau4}^2|-m_4$ limits]{Current $|U_{\tau4}^2|-m_4$ limits from NOMAD \cite{NOMAD:2001eyx}, ArgoNeut \cite{ArgoNeuT:2021clc}, CHARM \cite{Orloff:2002de, Boiarska:2021yho}, and DELPHI \cite{DELPHI:1996qcc}.}
  \labfig{boundsUtau}
\end{figure}
While the mixing with $\nu_{e/\mu}$ is strongly constrained\todo{Produce similar styled plot for these limits} ($|U_{\alpha4}^2| \lesssim 10^{-5}-10^{-8}, \alpha=e,\mu$), the mixing with $\nu_{\tau}$ is much harder to probe due to the difficulty of producing and detecting $\nu_\tau$. \reffig{boundsUtau} shows the current limits on the $\tau$-sterile mixing space for HNL masses between $0.1$\,GeV-$10$\,GeV. As was first pointed out in \sidecite{Coloma:2017ppo}, the atmospheric neutrino flux observed in IceCube offers a way to constrain the neutrino-HNL mixing parameters. By using the large fraction of atmospheric $\nu_{\mu}$ events that oscillate into $\nu_{\tau}$ before they reach the detector, the less constrained $\tau$-sterile mixing space can be explored. In this document, we present the methodology and strategy of a search for HNLs with IceCube DeepCore. These additional \textit{right-handed (RH)} neutrinos can be included in the Standard Model (SM) by extending the PMNS matrix to at least a 3x4 matrix as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:3_by_4_mixing_matrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
    \nu_{e}\\
    \nu_{\mu}\\
    \nu_{\tau}\\
    % \nu_{s}\\
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
    U_{e1} & U_{e2} & U_{e3} & U_{e4}\\
    U_{\mu1} & U_{\mu2} & U_{\mu3} & U_{\mu4}\\
    U_{\tau1} & U_{\tau2} & U_{\tau3} & U_{\tau4}\\
    % U_{s1} & U_{s2} & U_{s3} & U_{s4}\\
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
    \nu_{1}\\
    \nu_{2}\\
    \nu_{3}\\
    \nu_{4}\\
    \end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
where the components with index $4$ define the mixing between the flavor states and the fourth sterile mass state, respectively. Note here that this is not a theoretically fully consistent picture, but rather the phenomenologically minimal model to be tested by this analysis. This can hopefully be put into the larger context of several fully consistent models, later. Due to the singlet nature of the RH neutrinos, they only interact weakly, inheriting these interactions from their \textit{left-handed (LH)} neutrino counterparts via mixing. This mixing of the HNLs with the electron, muon, and tau neutrinos can be probed and constrained as a function of the HNL mass by searching for their production and decay. In \sidecite{Coloma:2017ppo, Coloma:2019qqj} this search is mainly motivated through two experimental arguments\todo{This section really needs to be re-written to motivate the search for HNLs from a more generic point of view (e.g. to explain neutrino masses)}.
% First, a decaying sterile neutrino could explain the low-energy excess (LEE) that is observed in the MiniBooNE data \sidecite{PhysRevLett.110.161801}.
Secondly, IceCube is ideally placed to explore the yet unconstrained $|U_{\tau4}|^{2}-m_{4}$ phase-space that is not easily accessible by accelerator-based experiments.


\subsection{The Minimal Standard Model Extension}

In order to probe the $\tau$-sterile mixing parameter, it is required to look at interactions involving $\tau$ neutrinos. However, most neutrinos produced in cosmic ray interactions with the atmosphere are $\nu_{e}$ or $\nu_{\mu}$. Therefore, we need these neutrinos to oscillate to the $\tau$ flavor before reaching the detector. For this to happen at the considered energies a traveled distance of the order of the earth diameter is necessary. This is why our signal is mostly up-going and passing through the whole earth.\todo{This section definitley needs to be elaborated in a little more detail}

To explain the signature we can observe in IceCube we first have to revisit the weak interactions that the HNL inherits from its LH counterpart through mixing. We will be following the derivation in \sidecite{Coloma:2020lgy}. Extending the SM by n additional RH neutrinos, $\nu_i$ ($i=3+n$), leads to the mass Lagrangian
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{\nu }^{\rm mass} \supset - \sum _{\alpha = e,\mu ,\tau} \sum _{i=4}^{3+n} Y_{\nu , \alpha i} {\overline{L}}_{L,\alpha} {\tilde{\phi }} \nu_{i} - \frac{1}{2} \sum _{i=4}^{3+n} M_{i} {\overline{\nu}}_{i} \nu^c_{i} + {\rm h.c.},
    \label{eq:hnl_mass_lagrangian}
\end{equation}
in a basis where the Majorana mass terms are diagonal. $Y_{\nu , \alpha i}$ are the Yukawa couplings to the lepton doublets and $M$ the Majorana masses for the heavy singlets. $L_{L,\alpha}$ stands for the SM LH lepton doublet of flavor $\alpha$ while $\phi$ is the Higgs field, and ${\tilde{\phi }} = i \sigma _2 \phi ^*$ and $\nu^c_{i} \equiv C {\bar{\nu}}_{i}^t$, with $C = i \gamma _0 \gamma _2$ in the Weyl representation. The full neutrino mass matrix with the Higgs vacuum expectation value $v/\sqrt{2}$ reads\todo{Not adding information about the case where the neutrinos have Dirac or pseudo-Dirac masses}
\begin{equation}
    {\mathcal {M}} = \left( \begin{array}{cc} {\mathbf {0}}_{3\times 3} &{} Y_\nu v/\sqrt{2} \\ Y_\nu ^t v/\sqrt{2} &{} M \end{array} \right),
    \label{eq:majorana_mass_matrix}
\end{equation}
and can be diagonalized by a $(3+n)$ x $(3+n)$ full unitary roation $U$, that itself leads to neutrino masses upon diagonalization, additionally manifesting the mixing between active neutrinos and heavy states. The resulting model consists of 3 light SM neutrino mass eigenstates $\nu_i$ ($i=1,2,3$) and n heavier states, as introduced above. The flavor states will now consist of a combination of light and heavy states
\begin{equation}
    \nu _\alpha = \sum _{i=1}^{3+n} U_{\alpha i} \nu_i,
    \label{equ:extend_neutrin_flavor_mass_relation}
\end{equation}
and the leptonic part of the EW Lagrangian can be written as
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \mathcal{L}^{\ell}_{\rm EW} &= \frac{g}{\sqrt{2}}W^+_\mu \sum _{\alpha } \sum _{i} U_{\alpha i}^* {\bar{\nu}}_{i}\gamma ^\mu P_L \ell _\alpha + \frac{g}{4c_w} Z_\mu \nonumber \\& \times \left\{ \sum _{i, j} C_{ij} {\bar{\nu}}_{i}\gamma ^\mu P_L \nu_j + \sum _\alpha {\bar{\ell }}_\alpha \gamma ^\mu \left[ 2s_w^2P_R\!-\!(1\!-\!2s_w^2)P_L \right] \ell _\alpha \right\} \nonumber + {\rm h.c.},
    \end{aligned}
    \label{eq:leptonic_ew_lagrangian}
\end{equation}
where $c_w \equiv \cos \theta _w$, $s_w \equiv \sin \theta _w$, and $\theta _w$ the SM weak mixing angle. $P_L$ and $P_R$ are the left and right projectors, respectively, while
\begin{equation}
    C_{ij} \equiv \sum _\alpha U^*_{\alpha i} U_{\alpha j}.
    \label{eq:general_squared_mixing}
\end{equation}
The indices now sum over all $(3+n)$ flavor and mass states.

Based on this formulation and assuming that only the mixing with the tau sector is open ($|U_{\alpha4}^2|=0, \alpha=e,\mu$), the relevant production diagram of the HNL can be drawn as shown in \reffig{HNL_production}. Alongside the fourth heavy mass state, a Hadronic cascade is produced. The heavy mass state will travel for some distance (dependent on mass and mixing) before it decays. The subsequent decay processes are depicted in \reffig{HNL_decay}. It can be a CC or NC decay and both leptonic and mesonic modes are possible (dependent on the mass). This will produce a tau or a tau neutrino and another cascade that can be EM or Hadronic. The branching ratios corresponding to the decay modes of the HNL for the mass range of interest (i.e. between \SI{100}{\mev} and 1\,GeV) are shown in \reffig{hnl_decay_modes_log_branching_ratio} as a function of the HNL mass.

The neutrino is an elementary particle in the SM \sidecite{Thomson_Particle}.
It belongs to the class of leptons, which itself is a subclass of elementary fermions (spin ${\frac{1}{2}}$ particles).
The fermions - six quarks and six leptons - form the matter content of the universe.
Quarks take part in all three interaction types (forces) of the SM: strong, weak, and EM \sidecite{GLASHOW1961579}.
The charged leptons - electron, muon, and tau - are subject to the weak and the EM interaction.
Neutrinos carry neither electric charge nor color charge and therefore only take part in weak interactions.
There are three distinct neutrino flavors - electron neutrinos, muon neutrinos and tau neutrinos ($\nu_e$, $\nu_{\mu}$, and $\nu_{\tau}$) \sidecite{PhysRevD.98.030001} - each corresponding to their charged lepton counterparts.

\todo{Plot is missing + for W and 0 for Z boson.}

In the SM, weak interactions are mediated by the three massive bosons $\textbf{W}^+$, $\textbf{W}^-$, and $\textbf{Z}^0$ \sidecite{Thomson_Particle}.
The large boson masses ($m_{\textbf{W}}\sim\SI{80}{\gev}, m_{\textbf{Z}}\sim\SI{90}{\gev}$) result in a short range of the force of about \SI{10e-18}{\meter}.
Weak interactions carried by $\textbf{W}^\pm$ bosons are called CC interactions, because charge is transferred between the interacting particles.
In CC interactions, a neutrino is converted into its corresponding charged lepton or vice versa.
Neutral current (NC) interactions are those mediated by $\textbf{Z}^0$ bosons.
Here no charge is transferred.
The Feynman diagrams for CC and NC interactions are shown in \reffig{weak_interactions}.

Although neutrinos are massless in the SM, we know today that they do have a small mass.
The observed phenomenon of neutrino oscillations (see Section \refsec{neutrino_oscillations}) is based on the fact that there is a mass difference between the three neutrino mass eigenstates.
From neutrino oscillation measurements the absolute mass scale cannot be determined, since they only depend on the mass differences, but there are upper limits on the sum of all neutrino masses from cosmological observations.
These upper limits are typically between $0.3$ and $1.3$\,eV \sidecite{PhysRevD.98.030001}.

\subsubsection{Neutrino-Lepton Scattering}

\subsubsection{Neutrino Interactions with Nuclei}

To describe the neutrino detection principle of IceCube explained in \refch{icecube} we need to understand the weak interaction processes that occur at the energies relevant for this work \SIrange[range-phrase=-]{10}{100}{\gev}.
The cross-sections are dominated by the following neutrino-nucleon interactions: quasi-elastic scattering (QE), resonant scattering (RES), and deep inelastic scattering (DIS).
The relative importance of the different processes depends on energy as can be seen in \reffig{cross_sections}.

\end{figure*}

At energies below \SI{5}{\gev}, QE and RES occur and the neutrinos interact with approximately point-like protons and neutrons.
The cross-sections of these processes are not linear in energy and the transition region to higher energies is poorly understood.
At higher energies, the interactions are dominated solely by DIS which has a linear dependence on energy above $\sim20\,$GeV.
For a given neutrino energy, it is possible to predict the cross-section in this region.
Here neutrinos interact with a single quark, breaking apart the nucleus and producing a shower of relativistic secondary particles.\todo{SB:
It seems that you have some double counting of information here . I suggest to move some of the information in this "intro" paragraph to the appropriate subsections}
Neutrino DIS is the primary detection channel of IceCube.
From \reffig{cross_sections} it can be seen that the interaction cross-sections are very small of the order of $10^{-38}\mathrm{\,cm}^2$.
Because of the small interaction cross-section, very large volume detectors are required to capture a sufficiently large sample of neutrinos to use for precision studies of their properties.
For example, the interaction length of a neutrino with $E_\nu = \SI{10}{\gev}$ is of $\mathcal{O}(10^{10}\,\mathrm{km})$.


\paragraph{Quasi-elastic scattering (QE)} with nucleons is the main process below \SI{1}{\gev}.
Protons are converted to neutrons in antineutrino interactions and vice-versa for neutrino interactions.
Additionally, a charged lepton corresponding to the neutrino/antineutrino flavor is produced.


\paragraph{Resonant scattering (RES)} describes the process of a neutrino scattering off a nucleon producing an excited state of the nucleon in addition to a charged lepton.
RES is the leading process at \SI{1.5e-5}{\gev} for neutrinos and \SI{1.5e-8}{\gev} for antineutrinos.


\paragraph{Deep inelastic scattering (DIS)} occurs if a neutrino carries sufficient energy to resolve the underlying structure of the nucleon and interacts with one of the composing quarks.
DIS is the dominant process above \SI{10}{\gev}. The nucleon breaks up and a lepton accompanied by a set of hadronic final states is produced.
Whether the lepton is the charged lepton corresponding to the interacting neutrino type, or the neutrino itself depends on the type of DIS interaction.
DIS happens via CC as in 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \nu_l + N \rightarrow l^- + X, \\
        \bar{\nu}_l + N \rightarrow l^+ + X, \\
    \end{split}
    \labeq{dis_cc}
\end{equation}
or NC interactions as
\begin{equation}
    \nu_l + N \rightarrow \nu_l + X.
        \labeq{dis_nc}
\end{equation}
Here, $X$ stands for any set of final state hadrons and $N$ for the nucleon.
The Feynman diagrams for the processes in \refeq{dis_cc} and \refeq{dis_nc} are shown in \reffig{dis_feynman}.

\subsection{Oscillations} \labsec{neutrino_oscillations}


\todo{(Re-)write BSM chapter for PhD thesis (just copy paste from M.Sc.).}

The flux of neutrinos used for this work exclusively comes from the Earth's atmosphere.
When highly relativistic cosmic rays (protons and heavier nuclei \sidecite{PhysRevD.98.030001}) interact in  the upper atmosphere they produce a shower of particles. 
Neutrinos emerge from the decays of charged pions and kaons ($\pi$ and $K$ mesons) present in these showers.
For energies below 100\,GeV, the leading contribution comes from the pion decay chain
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}   
        \pi^\pm &\rightarrow \mu^\pm + \nu_\mu(\bar{\nu}_\mu), \\
        \mu^\pm &\rightarrow e^\pm + \bar{\nu}_\mu(\nu_\mu) + \nu_e(\bar{\nu}_e).
    \end{split}
    \labeq{pion_decay}
\end{equation}
The muons that also originate from this process are considered the main background source for IceCube.
The left part of \reffig{honda_flux} shows the atmospheric neutrino flux for the very broad energy spectrum in which they are produced.
The flux expectations are calculated in the energy range of \SI{100}{\mev} to \SI{10}{\tera\electronvolt} for the South Pole \sidecite{PhysRevD.92.023004_Honda_Flux}, where the IceCube detector is located.
From \refeq{pion_decay} the ratio between muon and electron neutrinos can be inferred to be $N_{\nu_\mu}:N_{\nu_e} \approx 2:1$.
This is only the case at muon energies below 1\,GeV, where all muons decay in flight.
For higher energies, muons can reach earth before decaying increasing the ratio to approximately 10:1 at around 100\,GeV as shown in the right part of \reffig{honda_flux}.
Additionally, kaon decays start to contribute which also increases the number of muons and muon neutrinos.

In cosmic ray interactions, charged mesons or tau particles can also be produced, which leads to the formation of tau neutrinos.
However, at the energy range considered for this work, the resulting tau neutrino flux is negligible as compared to the muon neutrino flux \sidecite{2015EPJWC..9908001F_lepton_fluxes}\todo{SB:
You could say why with an extra half-sentence. 
} and is not taken into account.
% is less than 0.1\,\%  of the muon neutrino flux and can, therefore, be neglected.
It should be stated here that there is a rather large uncertainty on the normalization of the atmospheric neutrino flux on the order of 20-30\,\% \sidecite{PhysRevD.75.043006_neutino_flux_honda} in the energy region of interest.
This is mainly due to uncertainties in the primary cosmic ray spectrum and modeling of the hadronic interactions.\todo{SB:
I don't think this is true - the normalization is known to ~5\% if you trust Anatoli/Juan Pablo. Please have a look at more recent publications on this topic. }




There are two ways to describe neutrino wave functions based on their Hamiltonian eigenvalues \sidecite{BILENKY1978225}, as mass eigenstates or as flavor eigenstates.
When applying a plane wave approach to explain the propagation of neutrinos in vacuum, their mass eigenstates evolve as
\begin{equation}
    \ket{\nu_k(t)} = e^{-iE_kt/\hbar}\ket{\nu_k},
    \labeq{flavor_time_evol}
\end{equation}
where $E_k=\sqrt{\vec{p}^2c^2+m_k^2c^4}$ is the energy of the mass eigenstate $\ket{\nu_k}$, with momentum $\vec{p}$ and mass $m_k$.
Alternatively, they can be described in terms of their flavor eigenstates, which relate the neutrinos to the charged leptons they interact with in weak CC interactions.
The flavor eigenstates are $\nu_e, \nu_\mu$, and $\nu_\tau$, whereas the mass eigenstates are called $\nu_1, \nu_2$, and $\nu_3$ in the standard three-neutrino model.
To understand the propagation of distinct neutrino flavors in time we need to relate the flavor eigenstates to the mass eigenstates.
For massive neutrinos, each flavor eigenstate is a superposition of mass eigenstates \sidecite{PhysRevD.98.030001}
\begin{equation}
    \ket{\nu_\alpha} = \sum_kU^*_{\alpha k}\ket{\nu_k},
    \labeq{neutrino_mixing}
\end{equation}
where $\ket{\nu_\alpha}$ are the weak flavor states with $\alpha=e,\mu,\tau$ and $\ket{\nu_k}$ the mass states with $k=1,2,3$.
$U_{\alpha k}$ is the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix defining the mixing between mass and flavor eigenstates.
The mixing matrix can be parameterized as \sidecite{PhysRevD.98.030001}
\begin{equation}
    U=\left( 
    \begin{matrix}
        1 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & c_{23}  & s_{23} \\
        0 & -s_{23} & c_{23} 
    \end{matrix}
    \right) 
    \left( 
    \begin{matrix}
        c_{13} & 0 & s_{13}e^{-i\delta_{CP}} \\
        0 & 1 & 0\\
        -s_{13} e^{i\delta_{CP}} & 0 & c_{13}
    \end{matrix}
    \right) 
    \left( 
    \begin{matrix}
        c_{12} & s_{12} & 0 \\
        -s_{12} & c_{12} & 0\\
        0 & 0 & 1
    \end{matrix} 
    \right)  
    \operatorname{diag}(e^{i\rho_{1}},e^{i\rho_{2}},1),
    \labeq{PMNS_matrix}
\end{equation}\todo{SB:

}
where $c_{ij}=\cos\theta_{ij}$ and $s_{ij}=\sin\theta_{ij}$ are cosine and sine of the mixing angle $\theta_{ij}$, that defines the strength of the mixing between the mass eigenstates i and j and $\delta_{CP}$ is the neutrino CP-violating phase.
Nonzero, non-equal neutrino masses and the neutrino mixing relation in \refeq{neutrino_mixing} lead to the observed phenomenon of neutrino oscillations.
Oscillation means that a neutrino changes from its initial flavor to another flavor and back after traveling a certain distance.
A produced flavor eigenstate $\ket{\nu_\alpha}$ propagates through space as a superposition of mass eigenstates.
To find the probability that the initial flavor state $\ket{\nu_\alpha}$ ends up as the final flavor state $\ket{\nu_\beta}$ after the time $t$ we calculate
\begin{equation}
    P_{\nu_\alpha \rightarrow \nu_\beta}(t)
    =
    |\braket{\nu_\beta|\nu_\alpha(t)}|^2,
    \labeq{fermis_golden_rule}
\end{equation}
where $P$ is the probability calculated by applying Fermi's Golden Rule \sidecite{1927RSPSA.114..243D}.
Fermi's Golden Rule explains the transition rate from one energy eigenstate to another depending on the strength of the coupling between the two.
The strength of the coupling is described by the square of the matrix element.
Using the unitarity of the mixing matrix $U^{-1}=U^\dagger$ to reverse the relation \refeq{neutrino_mixing} and then time evolve the mass eigenstates with \refeq{flavor_time_evol} we get the time evolution of the flavor state $\ket{\nu_\alpha(t)}$.
Inserting this result into \refeq{fermis_golden_rule} yields
\begin{equation}
    P_{\nu_\alpha \rightarrow \nu_\beta}(t)
    =
    \sum_{j,k}U^*_{\beta j}U_{\alpha j}U_{\beta k}U^*_{\alpha k}e^{-i(E_k-E_j)t/\hbar},
    \labeq{probability_raw}
\end{equation}
where the indices $j$ and $k$ run over the mass eigenstates. For small neutrino masses compared to their kinetic energy, we can approximate the energy as
\begin{equation}
    E_k \approx E+\frac{c^4m^2_k}{2E} \hspace{0.25cm} \longrightarrow \hspace{0.25cm} E_k-E_j \approx \frac{c^4\Delta m^2_{kj}}{2E},
\end{equation}
where $\Delta m^2_{kj}=m^2_k-m^2_j$ is the mass-squared splitting between states $k$ and $j$.
If we now replace the time in \refeq{probability_raw} by the distance traveled by the relativistic neutrinos $t\approx L/c$ we get
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        P_{\nu_\alpha \rightarrow \nu_\beta}(t)
        = 
        \delta_{\alpha \beta}
        -
        4\sum_{j>k}&\textbf{Re}(U^*_{\beta j}U_{\alpha j}U_{\beta k}U^*_{\alpha k})\textrm{sin}^2\Big( \frac{c^3\Delta m^2_{kj}}{4E\hbar}L \Big) \\
        +
        2\sum_{j>k}&\textbf{Im}(U^*_{\beta j}U_{\alpha j}U_{\beta k}U^*_{\alpha k})\textrm{sin}^2\Big( \frac{c^3\Delta m^2_{kj}}{4E\hbar}L \Big),
    \end{split}
    \labeq{probability_detailed}
\end{equation}
which is referred to as the survival probability if $\alpha=\beta$ and the transition probability if $\alpha\neq\beta$.
The probability in \refeq{probability_detailed} is only nonzero if there are neutrino mass eigenstates with masses greater than zero.
Additionally, there must be a mass-squared difference $\Delta m^2$ and nonzero mixing between the states.
Since we assumed propagation in vacuum in \refeq{flavor_time_evol}, the transition and survival probabilities correspond to vacuum mixing.
