\chapter{Conclusion}
\labch{conclusion}


\todo{Write conclusion (RED)}


what was done?

1. set up model dependent and independent signal simulation for low energy double cascade events from HNL production and decay inside IceCube DeepCore

2. estimate performance of reconstructing and identifying these events

3. search for (cascade-like) events in 10 years of IceCube DeepCore data



possible improvements/future ideas for double cascade reconstruction and identification?

1. use more sophisticated machine learning algorithms for event selection and classification at lower levels
2. with icecube upgrade the performance of the existing reconstruction algorithms might improve (elaborate)
3. ml based reconstrucitons (GNN or so..)
