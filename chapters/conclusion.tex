what was done?

1. set up model dependent and independent signal simulation for low energy double cascade events from HNL production and decay inside IceCube DeepCore

2. estimate performance of reconstructing and identifying these events

3. search for (cascade-like) events in 10 years of IceCube DeepCore data
