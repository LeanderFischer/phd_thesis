what was done?

1. set up model dependent and independent signal simulation for low energy double cascade events from HNL production and decay inside IceCube DeepCore

2. estimate performance of reconstructing and identifying these events

3. search for (cascade-like) events in 10 years of IceCube DeepCore data


\section{Performance to Detecting Low Energetic Double Cascades}


\section{Search for Heavy Neutral Lepton Production and Decay}

\subsection{Agreement with Standard Model Three-Flavor Oscillation Measurement}

\todo{Compare here the best fit oscillation parameters to the FLERCNN results and try to quantify it, stating the pitfalls of the comparitions (satistically fully dependent) (RED)}

\section{Outlook}

\subsection{Shape Analysis Improvements}

\begin{itemize}
    \item estimate full contribution from cascade only events (underestimated due to limited sampling distributions)
    \item include double cascade classifier into Binning
    \item further optimize binning
\end{itemize}
