\section{Summary}

\subsection{Agreement with Standard Model Three-Flavor Oscillation Measurement}

\subsubsection{Shape Excess Search}



\section{Outlook}

\subsection{Shape Analysis Improvements}

\begin{itemize}
    \item estimate full contribution from cascade only events (underestimated due to limited sampling distributions)
    \item include double cascade classifier into Binning
    \item further optimize binning
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Test Coupling to Electron/Muon Flavor}

\subsection{Test Additional Coupling Processes}

\subsection{IceCube Upgrade}
