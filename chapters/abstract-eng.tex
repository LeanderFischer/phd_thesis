first search for heavy neutral leptons in the \si{\gev} mass range with IceCube DeepCore



extending the three flavor neutrino model by adding a fourth heavy mass state, considering three mass values $m_4$ of \SI{0.3}{\gev}, \SI{0.6}{\gev}, and \SI{1.0}{\gev} and allowing only mixing with the tau neutrino through the mixing parameter \ut4

the strength of the mixing is tested using atmospheric neutrinos as a production source of HNLs, using ten years of data taken between 2011 and 2021 to constrain the mixing parameter to \ut4$ < 0.09 (m_4 = \SI{0.3}{\gev})$, \ut4$ < 0.21 (m_4 = \SI{0.6}{\gev})$, and \ut4$ < 0.24 (m_4 = \SI{1.0}{\gev})$ at $68 \si{\percent}$ confidence level

no significant signal of HNLs is observed for any of the tested masses, and the best fit mixing values obtained are consistent with the null hypothesis of no mixing
