I would like to thank Marek for giving me the opportunity to conduct my research in the IceCube group at DESY. It was a pleasure to work in this group that combines the various research topics performed in IceCube but also offers the most friendly and welcoming atmosphere and wonderful collegues.

I especially want to thank Summer for her continuous support and guidance throughout my five years at DESY. Thank you for all the invaluable and honest feedback on my work and beyond. I am grateful for all the opportunities you gave me and for everything I learned from you. I am very happy that I had the chance to work with you!

I would also like to thank Alex who shared 2L01 with me throughout most of my time at DESY and was a precious resource of insights, new ideas, and prompt support on anything I was struggling with.
