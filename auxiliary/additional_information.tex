\chapter*{Foreword}

\textbf{Some general remarks:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Acronyms are introduced in \textit{italic font} the first time they are mentioned and will be used in normal font from then on.
    \item Software packages will be introduced in \textsc{small cap font} and later used in normal font. 
    \item All references are listed in its full extent in the bibliography, but additionally, a selection (but not necessarily all) of them will be highlighted in the margin next to where they appear to smoothen the flow of reading.
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Thesis related:}
